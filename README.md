# Skunkworks

This is some R&D code for the samizdapp project. Very messy, but functional. More docs coming soon. In the meantime, message Ryan with questions.

## Big Picture

This repo contains bare minimum setup to configure a dev environment or raspberry/rock pi into a wireguard VPN server and split tunnel DNS server via PiHole. Additionally, it contains a boneyard of other dockerized services.

## Getting started (Docker)

### Virtual machine guides

If you plan on running skunkworks in a virtual machine, we offer some guides to get you started:

- [VirtualBox](docs/VirtualBox.md)
- [Hyper-V](docs/HyperV.md)

Prerequisits: [docker, docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and [wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for your development machine and optionally a phone.
At least on Ubuntu, installing the `wireguard-tools` packaged does not pull down it's dependency `resolvconf`. So install that too.

This command can be used to install all dependencies:

```
sudo apt install git docker docker-compose wireguard-tools resolvconf`
```

- clone the repository and any submodules with `git clone https://github.com/samizdapp/skunkworks.git --recurse-submodules`.
- Add current user to the docker group, `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. And log out and back in or restart.
- run the `install.sh` script, this will start two wireguard interfaces and generate two client configurations
- visit http://localhost/wireguard to download client configuration `client1.conf`
- from a terminal, run `wg-quick up ./client1.conf`
- visit http://local.dns and http://roaming.dns to view the web interfaces for the two PiHole instances
- go back to http://localhost/wireguard and view `client2.png`
- scan the qr code with your mobile wireguard client
- activate the vpn and try to visit http://local.dns and http://roaming.dns from your phone (try turning off WiFi too to demonstrate roaming)

**NOTE: setting up the client VPN will redirect DNS queries to pihole over the VPN, this means that if you tear down the docker environment, you won't have DNS anymore until you tear down your client environment with `wg-quick down ./client1.conf`**

At this point, you now have a roaming capable tunnel to your dev environment, and can start hacking on other services.

## Getting started (Hardware)

Note: there are some magic strings in wireguard/Dockerfile and caddy/dockerfile. these need to be made configurable, but for now, change `amd64` to `aarch64` in all base image declarations, and uncomment the appropriate blocks in `wireguard/Dockerfile` depending on platform.

- get a raspberry pi or rockpi
- sign up for a free balena.io account
- set up your SBC for local development, find `<id>.local` for the device
- run `balena push <id>.local`
- wait until command line settles
- reboot device via balena website
- visit http://<id>.local/wireguard to download client configuration `client1.conf`
- from a terminal, run `wg-quick up ./client1.conf`
- visit http://local.dns and http://roaming.dns to view the web interfaces for the two PiHole instances
- go back to http://<id>.local/wireguard and view `client2.png`
- scan the qr code with your mobile wireguard client
- activate the vpn and try to visit http://local.dns and http://roaming.dns from your phone (try turning off WiFi too to demonstrate roaming)

At this point, you now have a roaming capable tunnel to your hardware environment, and can start hacking on services

## balenaOS in a VM (Development)

Running balenaOS in a virtual machine provides rapid iteration and feedback. Here are some guides to get you set up on your software of choice.

- [VirtualBox](docs/VirtualBox-dev.md)
- [Hyper-V](docs/HyperV-dev.md)

## Connecting Nodes

This approach is subject to rapid change, but currently this repo uses [wesher](https://github.com/samizdapp/wesher) (original by [@costella](https://github.com/costela/wesher))

to connect two nodes:

- complete "getting started" on both
- curl the invite command:
  - LAN: http://<id.local/localhost>/wesher/lan_invite.sh
  - WAN: http://<id.local/localhost>/wesher/wan_invite.sh
- copy the bash string into clipboard
- ssh/exec into other nodes wesher container
- paste and execute invite script

### Hacking Services

see [the services readme](./services/README.md) for the steps to add a service to the compose file, and an example.
